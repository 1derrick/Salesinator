# About
This project is designed to generate snippets of information for emails that can then be sent out to people who need information but can't quite figure out how to check documentation pages.
# Scope
Only publicly available information is stored in this extension. If you are not part of Duo and want to use this, feel free to use it as a base for designing your own cool tool! This software is offered as-is.
# ToDo:
        - dynamically build these lists through javascript
        - pull information from https://duo.com/docs so it is always up to date
        - have a pop-up window with the text to copy
        - copy the text directly to the clipboard when button is clicked
        - build logic to handle the order sections are rendered
        - change some 'select' elements to checkboxes e.g. the Features sections
